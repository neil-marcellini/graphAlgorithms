# graphAlgorithms
This project was my final lab assignment for COMP 151 Data Structures and Program Design. Please see Lab14.docx for instructions provided by Anna Biezczad which give a detailed description of what I did in the lab.

## Getting Started
The lab has 3 parts all setup as individual Intellij Idea projects. Please use Intellij Idea, then go to File -> Open. Navigate to the graphAlgorithms folder and select one of the folders within to run that part of the project.

Alternatively you may choose to read the provided sample runs for each part. The sample runs are the output of the program.

## What I Learned
While working on this project I learned to become comfortable working with complex data structures and interfaces. I had to do a lot of debugging in Intellij Idea, and since the program was more complex I had to write thoughtful tests to know exactly where the issue was coming from. It was not practical to navigate the entire data structure to find bugs. My completion of this lab demonstrates my ability to work through challenging problems on my own and implement algorithms efficiently.

## Acknowledgements
The basic structure of this program was created by professor Anna Bieszczad for COMP 151 Data Structures and Program Design at CSU Channel Islands.
